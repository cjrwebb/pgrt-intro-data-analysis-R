# R compared to software for Data Analysis 

* `R` is a programming language, rather than just a piece of software.
* `R` has a central repository that holds packages that can expand what you are capable of doing with it.
* `R` is free.
* `R` has a very supportive and active community around it. 
* `R` can do pretty much everything that any commercial software package can do, with a few very niche exceptions..

# If you can use a computer, you can program.

* It's not difficult, it's different. Getting used to something different takes time.
* Instead of clicking virtual or real buttons that apply functions (i.e. make things happen), we give commands by writing text.
* They are called **languages** for a reason — they have their own rules, grammar, and syntax — you have to practice them to get good at them.
* **But**, that doesn't mean you can't use phrasebooks, especially if you only use the language occasionally.

# We get errors all the time when using computers. The only difference between the errors you just saw and R errors is that the R errors are at least trying to tell you what went wrong.

# If you've ever used the "back" `r fontawesome::fa("angle-left")` or "undo" `r fontawesome::fa("arrow-rotate-left")` button, change something, and then do it again to get the result you want — congratulations, you've corrected an error.

# What we're going to cover today:

* A general rule for using code in R: things you have to change and things that stay the same. 
* Basic univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics using Base R
* Basic data visualisations using base R
* Common bivariate inferential statistics using base R
* Installing additional packages
* Reading datasets into R, including SPSS datasets
* Descriptive statistics using `tidyverse` and `janitor` tools
* Data visualisations using `ggplot2`

This is your phrasebook to help you on your R learning journey.
